## Gameplay

- A randomly chosen player starts, then turns proceed clockwise.
- At the start of the game, each player may look at their **two bottom cards** — only once during the game.

On each turn, exactly **one** of the following actions can be chosen:

### 1. Draw a card from the draw pile

- Draw the top card **face down**.
- If the drawn card is a **power card**, its action **may** be performed. Then, the power card is placed **face up** on the discard pile.
- If the power card’s action is **not performed**, the card can be swapped with one of your own cards in the 2×2 square or discarded without effect. The discarded card is placed face up on the discard pile, and the swapped card is placed face down in your square.
- If the drawn card is a **point card** (not a power card), it can be swapped with one of your own cards or discarded. The discarded card goes face up on the discard pile, and the swapped card is placed face down.

### 2. Draw a card from the discard pile

- Swap the drawn card with a card in your own 2×2 square.
- The discarded card is placed face up on the discard pile, and the swapped card is placed face down.

### 3. Knock

- Ends your turn **without drawing a card**.
- After a player knocks, no other player may knock.
- All other players have **one final turn**.
- The game ends when play returns to the player who knocked.

## Power Cards

Power cards have special actions **only when drawn from the draw pile** and placed on the discard pile without swapping.

| Card      | Action                                                                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Jack      | Blindly swap one of your cards with another player’s card.                                 |
| Queen     | Look at one of your cards and one of another player's cards, and optionally swap them.     |
| 7 or 8    | Look at one of your own cards.                                                             |
| 9 or 10   | Look at one of another player's cards.                                                     |

**Note:**  
- If a power card is swapped with a card in the 2×2 square, it loses its action.  
- Power cards revealed by swapping no longer have any effect.  
- Only power cards drawn directly from the draw pile have actions.

## Scoring

At the end of the game, points are totaled:

| Card       | Points    |
|------------|-----------|
| Ace        | 1         |
| Number 2-10| Face value|
| Jack, Queen| 10        |
| King       | -1        |

---

## End of the Game

- The game ends immediately after the player who knocked completes the round.
- The game also ends immediately if the last card from the draw pile has been drawn and played.
- The player with the **fewest points** wins.
- In case of a tie, players share the victory.
